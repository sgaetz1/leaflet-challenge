# leaflet-challenge
This is the repository for my leaflet homework. This project uses data from the United States Geological Survey and the Leaflet library in JavaScript to visualize earthquakes around the globe. This visualization can be seen at https://sgaetz1.github.io/leaflet-challenge/.

The map shows earthquake data from the past 30 days. Each circle on the map represents an earthquake and the size of the circle reflects the magnitude of the earthquake. The color of the circle indicates the depth of the earthquake, which is explained by the legend. If the user clicks on the circle, the place and the actual magnitude are displayed. The map's appearance can be changed from street map to dark map, topographic, or satellite map. The earthquake markers and tectonic plate lines can also be turned on and off.
